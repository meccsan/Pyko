Welcome to Pyko! I'm glad to have you here, and I hope you enjoy looking around, but first, let me explain what Pyko is.

# 1) What is Pyko?
Pyko is a hobby operating system designed to be similar to DOS, but different enough for it to be modern.
While Pyko may not have all of the bells and whistles that other operating systems have, it's its own little thing, and plus, give Pyko some slack, it's just a little fella.
Pyko doesn't hide the files from you, nor will it stop you, 'cause Pyko is as transparent as air.

Now that we got what Pyko *is* out of the way, lets move onto *why* Pyko exists.

# 2) Why am I making Pyko?
Pyko exists because I want to learn how computer *truly* work under the hood, and what better way than to make an operating system myself?
Furthermore, Pyko is really part learning experience, part serious OS. Despite all the comedic writing I put into the description of this GitHub repository, I do love working with stuff like this. I try to encourage people to take up their passions too, and again, what better way to get people into following their hobbies than to start with following mine? Plus, who know, might be useful for landing me a job at a big 'ol tech company in the future, eh?
Another reason for its existence is because I like the simplicity of DOS. It's just a TUI and yourself with a humming computer next do you, but I have bigger ideas and plans for Pyko. Hopefully it won't stay a book for too long!

Oh, by now you're probably wondering who I am! Here, lemme give you a little bit of a look in!

# 3) Who am I?
I'm Alexander Conrad, better known by meccsan. I'm big into technology, and have always had a big passion for it, and now that I'm 15 (at least at the time of writing this) with a decent computer, I think it's high time I started pursuing my love for computers. You might be wondering why a 15 year-old dude is making an OS based off DOS when he wasn't even around to experience it. **Just cause I wasn't around doesn't mean I haven't used the tech.** I have an old IBM ThinkPad 600 that runs Windows 95, and a majority of my time has been spent using MS-DOS on it. Due to that, I've found a love for how simple, yet complex it was. Somehow DOS managed to be both usable enough, but hard enough. So, out of admiration, and my desire to learn, I'm making Pyko.

# 4) Why is it called "Pyko"?
Originally, I was gonna name it PC TBOS, short for *Personal Computer Text-Based Operating System*, but quickly realized that it wouldn't stick, and was way too corporate. I then thought of just using PC OS, short for *Personal Computer Operating System*, but that's too literal, so I starting thinking of other ways to say it, and PikOS came to mind, and it would be pronounced [pee-kohs]; however, that was too close to some other things, and I didn't like it that much. Then came Pyko [pie-koh], and that's what I settled on. It's catchy, short, and just sounds like a name, nothin' fancy!

# Documentation & Manuals
If you want to read the documentation for the OS and its development, go to the DOCS folder in the GitHub repository. For manuals, go to the MAN folder in the GitHub repository. These are both updated as time goes on, so not everything will be up to speed since it takes time to write out several pages of documentation, and manuals won't be around until I release the first build of the OS.
