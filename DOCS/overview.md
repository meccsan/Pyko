# What Pyko *is*

Pyko is a hobby operating system that I designed so that I could learn how computers work under the hood, for me to have fun learning to program, and something for others to look at. I wanted to learn what my computer is really doing, and figured that there wouldn't be a better way to do that than actually making my own passion project. Pyko is also meant to be a functional operating system that people can actually use.

# What Pyko is *not*

A rip off of MS-DOS, Linux, or any other operating system. Though it's inspired, it's not a direct attempt at copying any other operating systems.

# What Pyko *won't* do

Steal any info or have any telemetry, actively harm your computer, or perform malicious acts.
